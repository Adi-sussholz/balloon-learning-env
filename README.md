# Balloon Learning Environment

The Balloon Learning Environment (BLE) is a simulator for training RL agents
to control stratospheric balloons. It is a followup to the Nature paper
["Autonomous navigation of stratospheric balloons using reinforcement learning"]
(https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2939-8).
